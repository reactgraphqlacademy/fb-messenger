import React from 'react'

/*

Here you can create your uncontrolled Input.

Hints:
- This component will be uncontrolled from the outer components, meaning this
component needs to keep track of the state of the input.
- Uncontrolled components receive a prop to "notify" the outer components that the
state has changed. That prop is normally called onChange.
- If you add the class form-control to your Input it will keep the style.
